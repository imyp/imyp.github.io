	<p>I am a protein chemist with interest in biology, computer science, math, and education. I have worked with both experimental and computational methods while studying at UCPH and while working at Novozymes and DTU. Read more about my experience in my <a href="https://imyp.github.io/cv/cv-en.pdf" title="Curriculum vitae">CV</a> or continue reading this page to learn what else I have created.</p>

	<p>I believe that the best way to learn new technologies and concepts are by applying them in practice. This is why I occassionaly solve problems or create personal projects that are useful or meaningful to me. See the projects I have worked on <a href="coding.html" title="Coding page">here</a>.</p>

	<p>I enjoy teaching and I am a strong believer that both visualizations and interactive material can be great tools when teaching. Find material that I create for teaching purposes <a href="teaching.html" title="Teaching Page">here</a>.</p>
