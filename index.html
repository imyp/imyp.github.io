      <section>
	<p>I am a protein chemist with interest in biology, computer science, math, and education. I have worked with both experimental and computational methods while studying at UCPH and while working at Novozymes and DTU. Read more about my experience in my <a href="https://imyp.github.io/cv/cv-en.pdf" title="Curriculum vitae">CV</a> or continue reading this page to learn what else I have created.</p>

	<p>I believe that the best way to learn new technologies and concepts are by applying them in practice. This is why I occassionaly solve problems or create personal projects that are useful or meaningful to me. In this section I share and write about the different projects I have been working on.</p>
	<h3 id="teaching">Teaching</h3>
	<p>I enjoy teaching and I am a strong believer that both visualizations and interactive material can be great tools when teaching. This section contains material that I have created to teach various concepts such as math or biochemistry and also recommends where to find good material elsewhere.</p>
	<h3 id="math">Math</h3>
	<p>I am a volunteer at <a href="https://www.matematikcenter.dk/" title="Matematikcenter homepage">Matematikcenter</a>, an organisation that helps middle and high school students with math problems.</p>
